# Homework 8

For this next assignment, we were asked to create a website where buyers and sellers can connect and items can be sold using the tools and resources we've learned this term (see Homework 1-7 for reference), keeping in mind of the requirements we need to implement as we went. (See assignment page)

In keeping in line with requirement 8 on the assignment page regarding portfolio content, I'm going to keep my log entry brief and mostly show a demo of the final product.

## Overview

This assignment was created on ASP.NET MVC using SQL scripts (which I then generated an Entity Relationship Diagram from), LINQ queries, (CS)HTML and JavaScript (where AJAX calls are made).
