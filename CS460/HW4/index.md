# Homework 4

For this next assignment, we were tasked with writing a ASP.NET MVC web application. Our goal was to write server-side dynamic web pages, one using ```GET``` -- which requests data from from a specified source, the other using ```POST``` -- which sends data to the server to create or update a resource.

## Step 1: Preparation

Before starting on this assignment, I took the time to learn Razor HTML, understand how ```GET```and ```POST``` methods work and get a handle how to create a web application with Visual Studio. The last part was difficult because while I found some tutorials at [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/getting-started) and [TutorialsTeacher.com](http://www.tutorialsteacher.com/mvc/asp.net-mvc-tutorials) on this matter, I didn't fully understand why things work the way they should and which files worked with what until Dr. Scot Morse showed the class some examples and the logic behind it.

## Step 2: Updating the Home Page

Having understood the material explained in the previous step, I felt I had the necessary knowledge and skills to get started on this homework. To begin, I updated the home page Microsoft auto-generated for me to match what my professor [had](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/images/hw4_home.png).

In ```index.cshtml```, I mostly updated the ```<p>``` and ```<h2>``` tags as well as the buttons as shown below:
